## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS for styling
- Flexbox for layout and alignment
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts for typography
- CSS Box Model for spacing and borders

### What I learned

I learned to add favicon, which is an icon associated with a webpage displayed in the browser's tab next to the page title.Here's how you can add a favicon:

```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="images/favicon-32x32.png" />
```

I also learned how to use a font family which is not installed in my device. Here's how you can use a font family form [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@100..900&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

```css
body {
  font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
  font-optical-sizing: auto;
  font-style: normal;
}
```

I also learned how to center the content vertically.Here's how you can do this.

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

God willing, I plan to focus on CSS layouts, particularly Flexbox, as I used it to vertically center my page in this project. Additionally, I aim to improve my skills in creating pixel-perfect applications that are consistent across both mobile and desktop designs.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT by OpenAI](https://openai.com/chatgpt/) - ChatGPT provided guidance on centering elements with Flexbox. This assistance was crucial in enhancing the quality of this project.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Google Fonts was used to implement the "Outfit" font, which improved the typography and overall visual appeal of the project. This resource is excellent for accessing a wide variety of free fonts for web development.
